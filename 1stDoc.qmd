## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## New Content

###Working with Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hits <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agmath/agmath.github.io/refs/heads/master/data/classification/battedballs.csv")

parks <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agmath/agmath.github.io/refs/heads/master/data/classification/park_dimensions.csv")

```

###Exploring Data

```{r}
#head(hits)

#better way to write, according to Dr. G
hits |> 
  head()
```
```{r}
parks |>
  head()
```

###Joining Datasets
```{r}
temp <- hits |>
  left_join(parks, by = c("park" = "park"))
```
