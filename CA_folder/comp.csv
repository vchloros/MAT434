Despite the modest amount of floor space, the property includes a **huge** yard that would be ideal for a couple with young children. Warning: This is an older house (built in 1970), and I had the same tenant in this house for 17 years without doing much in the way of remodeling and so the house needs a remodel and a facelift. The roof should probably be replaced and although the AC unit works, it is feeble. Because of these needs I am pricing the house very low, way below its ARV value and even lower than its tax assessed value. The tenant will be leaving in mid-October and you are welcome to interview her about the house if you inquire soon enough.

This house underwent a two-year full gut and remodel, which was completed in early 2020.  Nothing was left untouched.  This family friendly floor plan showcases an oversized kitchen, multiple living spaces, a large master suite, a dedicated private office on the main level and a 250 bottle climate controlled wine cellar.  The extent of the remodel was massive and included: a new exterior finish, a completely new yard that involved flattening both the front and back areas and the addition high-end synthetic turf in the back yard, a walk-through reflection pool to arrive at the front door, all new appliances, AC Units, a new metal seam roof, all new surfaces throughout the house, all new light fixtures, a new deck in the back, a whole house audio/visual and security system with surveillance cameras that you can control from your iPhone, all new steel windows and doors throughout the house, and the list goes on! The massive downstairs family room offers beautiful views of the backyard oasis, the warmth of a steel fireplace and beautiful steel doors that open to the outdoors for the perfect blend of indoors and out.  Through these doors awaits an amazing back yard oasis with flat turf yard, pool, spa, cabana with TV, an outdoor bathroom and shower, outdoor kitchen with built-in grill, and outdoor sound system perfect for entertaining.  The upstairs offers four additional bedrooms and four bathrooms, a reading nook, and a huge game/media room with kitchenette providing endless possibilities as a getaway for entertaining or privacy.  This brand new home takes full advantage of the excellent location, floor plan, and provides exceptional functionality for the whole family.

1147,"austin","A sense of history, coupled with a love of design, defines the spirit of Keith House, a designated historical sight in Austin's venerated and coveted Pemberton Heights neighborhood. A long, wide covered front porch leads to a modern glass and metal front door and a bronze medallion forever marking this home as an important part of Austin's architectural history.  Designed originally in 1933 for the sister of noted architect, William D. Anderson, the home was built on this site to take advantage of the Capitol view. Although the view is long since blocked by growth and progress, its proximity to the urban energy of Austin's city center remains a particular asset in this prime location.
            
            Once inside the gates that surround the property, graceful landscaping shaded by huge, mature oaks provides a secluded stage for dinners or drinks under a covered pergola that seats 12, with brick walls on 3 sides and a fireplace at one end. This outdoor haven, wired for music, invites both grand and intimate gatherings under the canopy of trees.
            
            Immaculate, sunlit rooms inside are spacious, comfortable and inviting.  Rich, stained wood floors throughout the house anchor rooms with carefully crafted moldings, cased openings and bookcases harkening back in time and painted in tones of ivory and white to keep the atmosphere light and modern.  Two large living areas on the first floor provide space for entertaining or peaceful relaxation.  Window coverings of shades or plantation shutters have been professionally selected and perfectly complete each room.
            
            The kitchen has been expanded from the original design, with brilliant white glass-front cabinets and ivory, white and gray granite counters.  A gas, six-burner commercial style stove sits below a custom vent hood.  A farmhouse double pulley pendant marries old and new while lighting the work space of a large island flanked by a built-in refrigerator and a separate wine fridge.
            
            A small office retreat off the kitchen is as inviting as the larger rooms with glass doors leading to the outside.              
            
            In the entry, a winding staircase makes for a sweeping and lovely route upstairs toward two spacious bedrooms, both with doors that open to balconies.  The master bath is filled with light and features white marble counters, a claw foot tub, a separate glass shower and marble baseboards.  The second bedroom works as another master adjoining its own spacious bath with black and white basketweave tile floors and soft green trim.
            
            Taking ownership of this home fulfills a love of architecture and an attachment to our now bustling city.  Austin may have expanded and grown up around this magnificent piece of history, but Keith House has been designed and updated to maintain a private, gated garden setting that defies time and lets progress sweep by while providing a stately, peaceful and comfortable retreat from this very, very busy city.","Single Family",30.2911567687988,-97.7572250366211,1,FALSE,1933,0,10454,7,16,3,2

Neighborhood Description

From the neighborhood association at http://rosedale-na.org/ 

""The majority of the homes in the Rosedale area were built during the 1930s and 1940s, giving them an allure not found with newer construction. The many renovation projects and new construction throughout the neighborhood lend a sense of vitality and renewal. The population of the neighborhood is a fabulous blend of young families, single professionals, and original owners who raised their children here and have many tales to tell.

Beyond the delightful charm of the area, the Rosedale neighborhood's location makes it one of the most desirable of Austin's neighborhoods. We have close proximity to the Capitol, the downtown area, and the University of Texas at Austin, as well as easy access to the main thoroughfares of our beautiful city.""

The current asking price represents good value for a great family home in great move-in shape, in which everything works. I will forego further painting (kitchen), replacing the carpeting and kitchen appliances. These are personal cosmetic choices for the new owner to make, if desired. This is a special house with a lot of extras and features not found in other homes in Lakewood. This home is on one of the largest lots in Lakewood and is one of the only Lakewood homes with an in-ground pool and spa. The pool and spa were recently re-tiled and re-plastered. There is a large attic over the garage and a very effective whole house fan in the garage. There are ceiling fans throughout the house. There are 2 independent environmental control areas for heating and cooling. The living room area AC/Heating complete system was recently replaced with high efficiency systems less than 2 yrs ago. The bedroom side AC/Heating (complete system) is being replaced and is brand new. 
I updated and improved much of the house while I’ve lived here. I installed granite countertops, new sinks, and new fixtures throughout. I removed all wallpaper, resurfaced, and painted the walls. A new, 30 year roof was added in 2005. All pool equipment (pumps, DE filter, pool heater) was replaced, and new water heater, new garage doors and openers were added recently.  I have kept my home well-maintained and in good repair. I have receipts and documentation for all additions, repairs, renovations. Most of the house was painted recently, including the garage and garage cabinets. The carpet is in good condition. The new owner may continue additional updating to enhance the value further and make it their own. 
Please contact through Zillow by email or leave message at 512-241-1660. I will show the house to prospective buyers by appointment or come by for the open house on Jan. 13.
